Problem: https://datalemur.com/questions/long-calls-growth

Solution:
WITH ct1 AS (SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM call_received) as y,
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM call_received) as m,
call_duration_secs as t
FROM callers),
ct2 AS (SELECT y,m,COUNT(*) FILTER(WHERE t>300) AS c
FROM ct1
GROUP BY y,m
ORDER BY y,m)

SELECT y,m,ROUND(100.0*(c-LAG(c) OVER(ORDER BY y,m))/LAG(c) OVER(ORDER BY y,m),1) as c2
FROM ct2

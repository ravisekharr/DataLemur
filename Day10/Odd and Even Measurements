Problem: https://datalemur.com/questions/odd-even-measurements

Solution:
WITH ct1 AS(
SELECT * ,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY DATE(measurement_time) ORDER BY measurement_time) as r
FROM measurements)

SELECT DATE(measurement_time) as measurement_day,
SUM(measurement_value) FILTER(WHERE r%2!=0) as odd_sum,
SUM(measurement_value) FILTER(WHERE r%2=0) as even_sum
FROM ct1
GROUP BY DATE(measurement_time)
ORDER BY measurement_day;

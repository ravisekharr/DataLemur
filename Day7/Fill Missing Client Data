Problem:https://datalemur.com/questions/fill-missing-product

Solution:
WITH ct AS(
SELECT *
FROM(
SELECT T1.product_id as product_id,T2.category as category,
T1.name as name,T2.r as r
FROM products T1
JOIN
(SELECT product_id,category,RANK() OVER(ORDER BY product_id) as r
FROM products
WHERE category IN(
SELECT category
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*)=1))T2
ON T1.product_id>=T2.product_id
ORDER BY product_id,T2.r)T3)

SELECT T1.product_id,T1.category,T1.name FROM ct T1 JOIN
(SELECT product_id,MAX(r) as mr FROM ct
GROUP BY product_id)T2
ON T1.product_id=T2.product_id
AND T1.r=T2.mr

Suggested solution:
WITH fill_products AS (
SELECT
  product_id,
  category,
  name,
  COUNT(category) OVER (ORDER BY product_id) AS category_group
FROM products)

SELECT
  product_id,
  FIRST_VALUE (category) OVER (
  	PARTITION BY category_group
    ORDER BY product_id) AS category,
  name
FROM fill_products;

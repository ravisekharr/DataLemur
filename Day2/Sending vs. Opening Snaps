Problem: https://datalemur.com/questions/time-spent-snaps

Note: See SUM FILTER commands

Solution:

SELECT age_bucket,
ROUND(s*100.0/(s+o),2) as send_perc,
ROUND(o*100.0/(s+o),2) as open_perc 
FROM age_breakdown
LEFT JOIN
(
SELECT T1.user_id,SUM(T1.send) as S,SUM(T1.open) as O
FROM (
    SELECT *,
    CASE WHEN activity_type='send' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END AS send,
    CASE WHEN activity_type='open' THEN time_spent ELSE 0 END AS open
    FROM activities) T1
  GROUP BY T1.user_id) T2
ON age_breakdown.user_id=T2.user_id
ORDER BY age_bucket;

Problem: https://datalemur.com/questions/prime-warehouse-storage

Solution:
WITH sales_sum(item_type,c,s) AS
(
SELECT item_type,COUNT(*) as c,SUM(square_footage) as s
FROM inventory
GROUP BY item_type),

prime_eligible(item_type,items,space) AS
(SELECT sales_sum.item_type,
FLOOR(500000/sales_sum.s) AS items,
sales_sum.s AS space
FROM sales_sum
WHERE sales_sum.item_type='prime_eligible' 
),
overall(item_type,space) AS
(SELECT sales_sum.item_type,
CASE WHEN sales_sum.item_type='prime_eligible' THEN sales_sum.c*prime_eligible.items
ELSE sales_sum.c*FLOOR((500000-(prime_eligible.space*prime_eligible.items))/sales_sum.s) END
AS item_count
FROM
sales_sum,prime_eligible
)
SELECT * FROM overall
ORDER BY space DESC;
